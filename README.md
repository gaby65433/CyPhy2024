## CyPhy2024: Cyber-Physical Computation Class Repository

This repository, created by **Gabriel Costa**, contains reports, code, and resources for the Cyber-Physical Computation (CyPhy) class in 2023/2024.

**Structure**

The repository is organized into two main folders:

* **TPCs (Homeworks):** This folder contains subfolders for each individual homework (TPC) assignment. Each TPC subfolder includes:
    * **Assignment:** A file containing the specific problem statement and requirements for the TPC (`.pdf`).
    * **Report:** The report document (`.pdf`) outlining the analysis and solutions for the assignment.
    * **Code:** The source code files developed to complete the TPC.

* **Group Assignments:** This folder contains subfolders for each group assignment (TPC) assignment, in a struture similar to the TPCs folder.
